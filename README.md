# Meteor Creative OP Items Tab
This is stolen from JFronny. I just put it in a seperate Addon to remove all the
Google Translate bloat.

Creative tab with several OP items partially taken from wurst modules (add items using the .save-item command or by editing .minecraft/meteor-client/additions_items.txt)
